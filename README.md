# Financial-Risk-Management-using-ML
Financial institutions need to continually weigh the risks of their transactions, and they determine their risk level through credit scoring. Leading up to the 2008-09 financial crisis, almost all large banks used credit scoring models based on statistical theories; that crisis, largely brought about by underestimating risk, proved the need for better accuracy in their scoring. The combination of increased requirements and the development of advanced new technologies has given rise to a new era: credit scoring using machine learning.

**We have focused on the Credit Scoring to check the risk associated with transactions**

Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders and financial institutions to determine the creditworthiness of a person or a small, owner-operated business. Credit scoring is used by lenders to help decide whether to extend or deny credit.
